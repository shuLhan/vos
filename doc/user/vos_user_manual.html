<h2 id="intro"> Introduction </h2>
Vos is a program to process formatted data, i.e. CSV data.
Vos is designed to process a large input file, a file where their size is
larger than the size of memory, and can be tuned to adapt with your machine
environment.
<br /><br />
Vos currently has four main features,
<ul>
<li>Sorting</li>
<p class="list-desc">
Vos can sort one or more field in input file in one pass.
</p>
<li>Reformatting</li>
<p class="list-desc">
By declaring only specific fields or using a different separator in vos
script, Vos can re-create a new file with a new format and data.
</p>
<li>Filtering</li>
<p class="list-desc">
Vos can omit and include specific data in specific field/record.
</p>
<li>Join</li>
<p class="list-desc">
Vos can join two file into one file with all or specific fields included in
output file.
</p>
</ul>

<h2 id="ch00">
Building and Compiling Vos </h2>
<p class="quote">
Vos was developed on GNU/Linux system, so any prerequisite below only valid
on system that running GNU/Linux system. Usually, any Unix like system
could compile the source, it just does not fully tested yet.
</p>

<h3 id="softreq" name="softreq">
Software Requirements </h3>

<p> This software/tools below is used in developing Vos, therefore we
recommended you to use the same or greater version when building Vos from the
source.</p>
<ul>
<li> GNU C Compiler
	<ul>
	<li> Version : 4.2.1_20070724 </li>
	<li> Website :
	<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org"> http://gcc.gnu.org </a></li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li> glibc development
	<ul>
	<li> Version : 2.6.1 </li>
	<li> Website :
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html">
http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html </a> </li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li> GNU Make
	<ul>
	<li> Version : 3.81 </li>
	<li> Website :
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">
http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html </a> </li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="make" name="make">
Compiling Vos From Source </h3>
<p class="quote">
This step assume that you already get the source and saved into your machine.
</p>

<pre class="box-script">
	$ tar jxvf vos-xxxx.xx.xx.tar.bz2
	$ cd vos/src
	$ make
</pre>

<p>
Where xxxx.xx.xx is Vos version (depend on which version that has been
downloaded). When running "make", make program will create directory "build"
in "vos" directory, vos executable is placed in there (vos/build).
</p>
<p>
For later use, you should copy Vos executable to your PATH directory. In
example:
</p>
<pre class="box-script">
	$ pwd
	/home/johndoe/tmp/vos/src
	$ echo $PATH
	/home/johndoe/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
	$ cp ../build/vos /home/johndoe/bin
</pre>

<h2 id="ch01">
Running Vos </h2>
<p>
Vos program only have one parameter: vos script.
</p>
<pre class="box-script">
	vos &lt; vos-script &gt;
</pre>
<p>
<span class="script">vos-script</span> is a file contains <a href="#vos_stmt">
vos statements </a> that will be executed and processed.
</p>

<h3 id="vos_env"> Vos Environments </h3>
<p>
Before running Vos program, there are severals environment variables that you
can set to change behaviour of program while running. Some of the environment
variable also can be set at the vos script using <a href="#vos_var"> Vos
variables. </a>
</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="script"> VOS_DEBUG &lt; number &gt; </span>
<p class="list-desc">
Default value : 0
<br /><br />
This variable is an optional and used only for debugging, normal use/user
should not use this parameter. The <span class="script"> VOS_DEBUG </span>
environment variables can have a value,
</p>
<ul>
<li> 1 : for testing the script only, not process it </li>
<li> 2 : for debugging parsing process </li>
<li> 4 : for debugging sort process </li>
<li> 8 : for debugging create process </li>
<li> 16 : for debugging join process </li>
</ul>
<p class="list-desc">
Those value can be combined to get more debug output.
</p>
<p class="list-desc">
Example on setting <span class="script"> VOS_DEBUG </span> variable on Bash
shell,
</p>
<pre class="box-script">
	$ export VOS_DEBUG=3
</pre>
<p class="list-desc">
this value will tell Vos program to debug parsing process (2) but will not
process the script (1).
</p>
</li>
</br>
<!-- VOS_DEBUG end -->

<li>
<span class="script"> VOS_FILE_BUFFER_SIZE &lt; number &gt; </span>
<p class="list-desc">
Default value : 8192
<br /><br />
This variable is used to set size of buffer for read/write on file, in bytes.
<br />
This example set buffer size to ~ 1 MB,
</p>
<pre class="box-script">
	$ export VOS_FILE_BUFFER_SIZE=1000000;
</pre>
</li>
<br />
<!-- VOS_FILE_BUFFER_SIZE end -->

<li>
<span class="script"> VOS_COMPARE_CASE &lt; number &gt; </span>
<p class="list-desc">
Default value : 0
<br /><br />
This variable affect order on sort output.
<br />
If <span class="script"> VOS_COMPARE_CASE </span> is set to 0, "B"
will come first then "a", but
<br />
if <span class="script"> VOS_COMPARE_CASE </span> is set to 1, "a"
will come first then "B".
<br />
Example on how to set it on Bash shell,
</p>
<pre class="box-script">
	$ export VOS_COMPARE_CASE=0; # or
	$ export VOS_COMPARE_CASE=1;
</pre>
</li>
<br />
<!-- VOS_COMPARE_CASE end -->

<li>
<span class="script"> VOS_PROCESS_MAX &lt; number &gt; </span>
<p class="list-desc">
Default value : 2
<br /><br />
This variable affect on how many thread will be used for sort process. The
recommended value is equal to a number of processor that you have on your
machine.
<br />
Example on how to set it on Bash shell,
</p>
<pre class="box-script">
	$ export VOS_PROCESS_MAX=8;
</pre>
</li>
<br />
<!-- VOS_PROCESS_MAX end -->

<li>
<span class="script"> VOS_PROCESS_MAX_ROW &lt; number &gt;</span>
<br />
<br />
<p class="list-desc">
Default value : 100,000
<br /><br />
This variable affect on how many "row" that program must keep in memory before
writen to temporary file.
<br />
Example on how to use it:
</p>
<pre class="box-script">
	$ export VOS_PROCESS_MAX_ROW=400000;
</pre>
</li>
<br />
<!-- VOS_PROCESS_MAX_ROW -->

<li>
<span class="script">
VOS_TMP_DIR
&lt;double-quote&gt;&lt;string&gt;&lt;double-quote&gt;[:] ... </span>
<br />
<br />
<p class="list-desc">
Default value : /tmp/
<br /><br />
While in sort process, program sometime use temporary file. This temporary
file usually, as default, placed in "/tmp/" directory. You can add two or more
directories as temporary directory, as long as there is free space and user
who run the Vos program has a write access to it.
<br /><br />
We recommended that you to use a temporary directory that has a place in a
different disk than input file, for technical reason it's decrease processing
time.
<br /><br />
</p>
<pre class="box-script">
	$ export VOS_TMP_DIR="/var/tmp/";
</pre>
<p class="list-desc">
which result that program will use "/tmp/" (default from program), "/var/tmp/",
and "/media/tmp/" as temporary directories.
<br /><br />
Another example :
</p>
<pre class="box-script">
	$ export VOS_TMP_DIR	"/media/tmp/":"/disk01/";
</pre>
<p class="list-desc">
which result that program will use "/media/tmp/" and "/disk01/" as temporary
directories.
</p>
</li>
<br />


</ul> <!-- Vos Environment -->

<h2 id="ch02"> Vos Script </h2>
<p>
To illustrate on how Vos script work, we will use two input files as an example
here, "artist.data" and "album.data".
</p>

<span class="script"> artist.data </span>
<pre class="box-script">
1,"Broken Social Scene"
2,"U2"
3,"Led Zeppelin"
4,"John Legend"
5,"Deep Purple"
</pre>

<span class="script"> album.data </span>
<pre class="box-script">
'You Forgot it in People'   1
'Burn'                      5
'Get Lifted'                4
'The Joshua Tree'           2
'Broken Social Scene'       1
</pre>


<h3 id="vos_var"> Vos Variables </h3>
<p class="quote">
Vos variable is used with "SET" statement.
</p>
<p>
Vos variable is used to adapt with the environment where Vos will be running.
For example, let say that you have a machine with 8 processor and 16 GB of
memory and you want to sort 20,000,000 rows of data with it's size maybe
about 2 GB. Instead of using default maximum row (which is 100,000) with two
thread you can set maximum row to 2,500,000 and maximum thread to 8, which
will decrease processing time.
</p>
<p>
There are two method to set Vos variable, first, by explicitly defined it on
vos script by using <span class="script">SET</span> statement; second, by
defined in environment variable using shell <span class="script">set</span> or
<span class="script">export</span>.
</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="script"> FILE_BUFFER_SIZE &lt;number&gt; </span>
<br />
<br />
<p class="list-desc">
Default value : 8192
<br /><br />
This variable is used to set size of buffer for read/write on file, in bytes.
<br />
This example set buffer size to ~ 1 MB,
</p>
<pre class="box-script">
	set FILE_BUFFER_SIZE 1000000;
</pre>
</li>
<br />

<li><span class="script">PROCESS_COMPARE_CASE_SENSITIVE</span> (default) </li>
<li><span class="script">PROCESS_COMPARE_CASE_NOTSENSITIVE</span>
<br />
<br />
<p class="list-desc">
This variable affect order on sort output.
<br />
If <span class="script"> PROCESS_COMPARE_CASE_SENSITIVE </span> is used, "B"
will come first then "a", but
<br />
if <span class="script"> PROCESS_COMPARE_CASE_NOTSENSITIVE </span> is used "a"
will come first then "B".
<br />
Example on how to use it:
</p>
<pre class="box-script">
	set PROCESS_COMPARE_CASE_SENSITIVE;
	set PROCESS_COMPARE_CASE_NOTSENSITIVE;
</pre>
</li>
<br />

<li>
<span class="script"> PROCESS_MAX &lt;number&gt; </span>
<br />
<br />
<p class="list-desc">
Default value : 2
<br /><br />
This variable affect on how many thread will be used for sort process. The
recommended value is equal to a number of processor that you have on your
machine.
<br />
Example on how to use it:
</p>
<pre class="box-script">
	set PROCESS_MAX 8;
</pre>
</li>
<br />

<li>
<span class="script"> PROCESS_MAX_ROW &lt;number&gt;</span>
<br />
<br />
<p class="list-desc">
Default value : 100,000
<br /><br />
This variable affect on how many "row" that program must keep in memory before
writen to temporary file.
<br />
Example on how to use it:
</p>
<pre class="box-script">
	set PROCESS_MAX_ROW 400000;
</pre>
</li>
<br />

<li>
<span class="script">
PROCESS_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY
[:]&lt;double-quote&gt;&lt;string&gt;&lt;double-quote&gt;[:] ... </span>
<br />
<br />
<p class="list-desc">
Default value : /tmp/
<br /><br />
While in sort process, program sometime use temporary file. This temporary
file usually, as default, placed in "/tmp/" directory. You can add two or more
directories as temporary directory, as long as there is free space and user
who run the Vos program has a write access to it.
<br /><br />
We recommended you to use a temporary directory that has a place in a
different disk than input file, for technical reason it's decrease processing
time.
<br /><br />
When <span class="script">':'</span> is set as the first character in a string
value then the rest of value is added to the list of temporary directory,
which means the last or the default temporary directory will not be replaced.
This setting allow you to add several directories in two or more SET
statement.
In example :
</p>
<pre class="box-script">
	SET PROCESS_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY		:"/var/tmp/";
	SET PROCESS_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY		:"/media/tmp/";
</pre>
<p class="list-desc">
which result that program will use "/tmp/" (default from program), "/var/tmp/",
and "/media/tmp/" as temporary directories.
<br />
Another example :
</p>
<pre class="box-script">
	SET PROCESS_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY		:"/var/tmp/";
	SET PROCES_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY		"/media/tmp/":"/disk01/";
</pre>
<p class="list-desc">
which result that program will use "/media/tmp/" and "/disk01/" as temporary
directories but not include "/var/tmp" because it's has been override by the
last SET statement.
</p>
</li>
<br />

<h3 id="vos_stmt"> Vos Statements </h3>
<p class="quote">
Vos script is not case sensitive, "Load" is equal with "LOAD".
</p>

<h4 id="set_stmt"> Set Statement </h4>
<img class="image" src="image/set_stmt.png" alt="vos set statement"/> <br />
For example on how to use Set Statement and list of variable see
<a href="#vos_var">Vos Variable.</a>

<h4 id="load_stmt"> Load Statement </h4>
<img class="image" src="image/load_stmt.png" alt="vos load statement" /> <br />
<ul>
<li><i>/path/to/input/file</i> is path to input file that you want to process.
</li>
<li> Input file must be enclosed by a double-quote character. </li>
<li> For field declaration see <a href="#field_clause"> Field Clause </a></li>
<li> <i> alias </i> is optional, but we recommended you to use it for easy of use
later.  </li>
<li> Declaring Load statement only does not process anything, it just for
defining your input file and their fields. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Example on using Load Statement:
</p>
<pre class="box-script">
LOAD "artist.data" (
	   :idx :   ::',',
	'"':name:'"'::
) as artist;

LOAD "album.data" (

</pre>

<h4 id="sort_stmt"> Sort Statement </h4>
<img class="image" src="image/sort_stmt.png" alt="vos sort statement" />
<ul>
<li>Please note that the default setting in sort is <u>case sensitive</u> and in
	<u>ascending</u> order. To change case sensitive to not-sensitive use
	<a href="#set_stmt"> SET statement.</a>
<li>If <span class="script">INTO</span> is not defined then sort output will
	be written into a file "sort.XXXXXXXX", where "XXXXXXXX" will be
	replaced by a random characters.
</ul>
<p>
Example on using Sort Statement:
<br />
<br />
This script will sort <span class="script"> artist.data </span> by
<span class="script"> name </span> (second field) on descending order,
</p>
<pre class="box-script">
LOAD "artist.data" (

<p> If you run the script the output would be like this, </p>
<pre class="box-script">
2|U2
3|Led Zeppelin
4|John Legend
5|Deep Purple
1|Broken Social Scene
</pre>

<p>
This script will sort
<span class="script"> album.data </span> by

<h4 id="create_stmt"> Create Statement </h4>
<img class="image" src="image/create_stmt.png" alt="vos create statement" />
<p>
Create statement is used to create a new data with new format or with
different field output order. <br />
Create statement also can be used to combine several input file into one file.
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>/path/to/output/file</i> is path to output file where data will be
written. This value must be enclosed with double quote.</li>
<li> For field declaration see <a href="#field_clause"> Field Clause </a>.</li>
<li> For filter declaration see
<a href="#filter_clause"> Filter Clause </a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Example on using Create Statement,
<br />
<br />
This script will combine <span class="script"> artist.data </span> and
<span class="script"> album.data </span> into one file, fields will be
separated by <span class="script">'|'</span>.

<h4 id="join_stmt"> Join Statement </h4>
<img class="image" src="image/join_stmt.png" alt="vos joint statement" />
<img class="image" src="image/join_rules.png" alt="vos join rules" />
<p>
Join statement is used to combine two input file into one file, like create
statement, but using specific fields as a matching rule.
</p>

<ul>
<li> if <span class="script"> '+' </span> is defined then the match row and
	non-match row will be writen to output file. </li>
<li> if <span class="script"> '-' </span> is defined then the match row will
	not be writen but non-match row will be writen to output file.</li>
<li> if non of <span class="script"> '+' </span> and
	<span class="script"> '-' </span> is defined only the match row will
	be writen to output file. </li>
<li> Default input file is in <span class="script">UNSORTED</span>. It's
	important to defined <span class="script">SORTED</span> if you know
	that input file is already sorted, so Vos will not sort them again before
	processing join. </li>
<li> If <span class="script">INTO</span> is not defined then output file will
	be writen to a file "join.XXXXXXXX" where "XXXXXXXX" will be replaced
	by a random characters. </li>
</ul>

<p>
Example on using Join statement,

<h4 id="field_clause"> Field Clause </h4>
<img class="image" src="image/field_clause.png" alt="vos field clause" />

<ul>
<li> <i> left-quote </i>, <i>right-quote</i> and <i>separator</i> can be any
	single character. </li>
<li> <i> left-quote </i>, <i>right-quote</i> and <i>separator</i> must be
	enclosed by single quote.</li>
<li> If charater in single quote is it self (single quote) it must be prefixed
	with backslash, i.e: <span class="script"> '\'' </span>.
<li> <i>start-position</i> is a number begin from zero.</li>
<li> <i>end-position</i> is a number begin from 1 and must be greater that
	<i>start-position</i>. </li>
<li> <i>field-type</i> is a string indicated type of data in the field. It's
	value is only two : <span class="script">STRING</span> or
	<span class="script">NUMBER</span>.</li>
</ul>


<h5>Priority of quote vs position vs separator</h5>

<p>
First, when reading field data <i>start-position</i> is have a higher priority than
<i>left-quote</i>. In example, suppose that input data is like this,
</p>

<pre class="box-script">
'You Forgot it in People'
</pre>

<p> and you defined field like this, </p>
<pre class="box-script">
	'\'':field00:'\'':4:22:
</pre>

<p>
Vos will always read from position 4, not from first character of
<i>left-quote</i>, which result <span class="script">" Forgot it in Peopl"</span>.
</p>

<p>
Second, while reading field data <i>end-position</i> have a higher priority
than <i>right-quote</i>, and <i>riqht-quote</i> is have a high priority than
<i>separator</i>.
</p>

<h4 id="filter_clause"> Filter Clause </h4>
<img class="image" src="image/filter_clause.png" alt="vos filter clause" />
<ul>
<li><span class="script">'='</span> mean is case not-sensitive compare, "a" is
	equal with "A".</li>
<li><span class="script">'=='</span> mean is case sensitive compare, "a" is
	<u>not</u> equal with "A".</li>
<li>The only limitation here is <i>field-name</i> must be in left and the value in
	right, not vice versa. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Example of using filter:
<br />
<br />
This script will only write artist and album where it's field
<span class="script">idx</span> value is 1.
</p>

<pre class="box-script">
LOAD "artist.data" (
	   :idx :::',',
	'"':name:'"'::
) as artist;

LOAD "album.data" (
	'\'':title     :'\''::,
	    :artist_idx:    :28:28
) as album;

CREATE "filter_artist_album.data" from artist, album (
	   :artist.idx	:::'|',
	'"':artist.name	:'"'::'|',
	'[':album.title	:']'::
) FILTER (
        ACCEPT artist.idx = 1,
        REJECT album.artist_idx != 1
);
</pre>
